## Note
This is organization-specific currently, but may be made into something more reusable at a later date. You might be able to make use of it by forking and taking some stuff out.

## Setup
* Create a course that will contain the users you want to display in the directory.
* Select that course in the block settings.
* Enrol users into that course to display them in the directory.
